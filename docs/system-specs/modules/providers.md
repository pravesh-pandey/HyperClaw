## LLM Provider Abstraction

Kiro Crew drives one provider implementation, `AcpProvider`, over ACP. The
`LLMProvider` interface is retained as a thin seam (consumers depend only on the
ABC), and `agent.provider` remains fixed to `acp`; the selected harness lives in
`agent.acp_backend`.

```

**Note:** the removed Bedrock provider and the removed standalone provider were
**deleted** during de-Amazoning, along with their config fields and the
multi-provider dispatch factory. `AcpProvider` adapts the first-class Kiro
harness plus the public Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode ACP harnesses, while KAS
remains an ACP runtime variant. The provider selector was not reintroduced; the harness
choice is `agent.acp_backend`.

### LLMProvider ABC (`providers/base.py`)

```python
class LLMProvider(ABC):
    async def start() -> None
    async def shutdown() -> None
    async def stream(message: str) -> AsyncIterator[LLMEvent]
    async def approve_tool(request_id) -> None
    async def reject_tool(request_id) -> None
    def context_usage_pct() -> float
    # Optional (have defaults):
    async def stream_command(command: str) -> AsyncIterator[LLMEvent]
    async def compact(context: str = "") -> None
    async def wait_for_compaction(timeout: float = COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS) -> dict
    async def cancel(*, wait_ack_timeout: float = 0.0) -> CancelOutcome
    def is_alive() -> bool
    def touch_activity() -> None
```

### LLMEvent (`providers/base.py`)

Provider-agnostic event dataclass (aliased from `AcpEvent`):

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `text_chunk` | Text output from agent |
| `thinking_chunk` | Extended thinking (Claude 3.7+) |
| `tool_call` | Tool invocation |
| `tool_result` | Tool output |
| `permission_request` | Tool approval request (ACP only) |
| `complete` | End of turn |
| `compaction_status` | Compaction result |
| `clear_status` | Clear display |
| `agent_switched` | Agent mode changed |
| `mcp_oauth_request` | MCP server needs OAuth (has `server_name`, `oauth_url`) |
| `mcp_server_initialized` | MCP server ready after OAuth (has `server_name`) |
| `mcp_server_init_failure` | MCP server OAuth/init failed (has `server_name`, `text`) |

### AcpProvider (`providers/acp.py`)

The provider. Spawns a long-lived ACP subprocess for the selected harness and
speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio.

`acp_backend` selects Kiro (`""`), Claude (`"claude"`), Codex (`"codex"`),
OpenCode (`"opencode"`), or KAS (`"kas"`). Kiro stays the default and first-class path; adapter spawn,
protocol, model, and effort differences are explicit capability sets documented
in [`acp-client.md`](acp-client.md). Do not re-add a second provider selector.

**Harness choice is per chat session.** `_ChatSlot.acp_backend` carries it and
`POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/backend` sets it; the provider factory takes it as
`acp_backend_override`, and `None` (no per-session pick) inherits
`agent.acp_backend`. There is no provider control in Settings — the last switch
a session made is written back to `agent.acp_backend` as the sticky default for
NEW sessions, so stickiness inherits the normalization and governance floor that
key already has rather than adding a second store.

Three consequences the code depends on:

- **No live switch.** A harness is a different subprocess with an incompatible
  session id, so the endpoint always resets the slot and lets the existing
  provider-switch path (`detect_provider_switch` → `build_session_replay`) carry
  the conversation. Model and effort keep their live-switch behaviour — but only
  while the live process is still the harness the slot selects.
  `_live_harness_is_stale` compares both backend strings and refuses the
  in-place `set_model` otherwise, because for a window after the switch the slot
  names the NEW harness while the process is still the OLD one. Sending the pick
  anyway asks the old harness for the new harness's id: picking Claude's
  `sonnet` came back refused against Codex's `gpt-5.6-*` catalog, reported as an
  account-entitlement problem that had nothing to do with the cause. The reset
  respawns on the selected harness and applies the model where it means
  something.
- **The model pin is dropped in the same commit.** A model id is only meaningful
  inside one harness's namespace (`acp_effective_model` translates per backend:
  raw for a member of `ACP_BACKENDS_OWN_MODEL_CATALOG`, `to_acp_id` otherwise),
  so carrying it across would pin an id the new harness cannot serve.
- **The warm pool is bypassed** (`bypass_backend`) whenever the per-session pick
  differs from the configured harness: the pool is pre-spawned from the
  configured one, and claiming from it would hand the session a harness it did
  not choose.

`GET /api/models?slot=` scopes the advertised set to that session's harness;
`?backend=<id>` names one outright (the Settings role pickers ask about
harnesses no session may be running, so there is nothing to infer from) and wins
over `?slot=`. With neither, the configured default answers.
`GET /api/effort-levels` takes the same two parameters, for the same reason:
effort ladders are per-harness (Codex has no `default` rung, Claude has one), so
a static list offers levels one adapter refuses.

### The cold picker: reading a catalog with no session

Both endpoints must answer BEFORE a session exists, because that is the setup
case — an operator choosing a harness, its default model and its effort level
has by definition not opened a chat on it. kiro-cli answers from
`kiro-cli chat --list-models` and OpenCode from `opencode models`; Claude and
Codex have no catalog subcommand at all and report theirs only in `session/new`'s
`configOptions`, so both controls were empty exactly while being configured.

`acp/adapter_catalog.py` closes that: a full ACP handshake — spawn, `initialize`,
`session/new`, read, tear down — driven through `AcpClient` rather than
hand-rolled JSON-RPC, so it inherits the spawn path, sandbox posture, env
scrubbing and teardown the chat session already uses and cannot drift from them.
No prompt is sent, so no tokens are spent.

Three properties are load-bearing, because this spawns a process:

- **A live session always wins.** The probe runs only when the advertised list
  is still just the `auto` sentinel. Probing past a live session would spawn a
  second adapter to re-learn what the first one already reported.
- **Cached with a TTL, and single-flighted per harness.** Entitlement changes on
  a plan change, not on a page load, while the picker polls every 8s whenever it
  is degraded — so without both, every poll would spawn an adapter and
  concurrent pollers would spawn one each. A FAILED probe is cached far more
  briefly (`FAILURE_TTL_SECONDS`): its common causes — adapter not installed,
  not signed in — are the ones an operator fixes and immediately retries.
- **It never raises.** Any failure yields an empty catalog and the picker shows
  its `auto` sentinel, which is what it did before the probe existed. A
  read-only picker must not 5xx because a harness is not set up yet.

### Per-role harnesses

`agent.role_backends` pins a harness per task class, with the same keys as
`agent.role_models` (`background`, `subagent`) — the configuration this exists
for is an expensive harness for interactive chat and a cheaper one for
unattended work. `AgentConfig.resolve_backend(role)` is the reader.

It differs from `resolve_model` in one deliberate way: **an unset role inherits
`agent.acp_backend`.** A model has an `auto` sentinel the provider can resolve
for itself; a harness does not, so the only sane "unset" is "the same one chat
runs on". The role map therefore distinguishes an absent key (inherit) from an
explicit `""` value (pin Kiro CLI): `""` is kiro-cli's real wire id, and dropping
it would make it impossible to pin unattended work to Kiro when chat uses a
different harness. The UI may present an absent value as "Same as chat"; the
chat row and an explicit role pin spell `""` "Kiro CLI".

`AgentConfig.resolve_model(role)` makes the complementary choice: an unset role
resolves to `auto` inside its selected harness and never inherits `agent.model`.
This keeps unattended work from silently following an interactive chat pin.

Two spawn paths honour the pin, and a pin that does not reach one of them is
decoration:

- **Background** — `session_background._configured_bg_backend_raw()` resolves
  the `background` role instead of reading `agent.acp_backend`. The existing
  displacement machinery then applies for free: a `_bg` runtime whose backend no
  longer matches is killed if idle and parked if it has live handles. The
  provider-backed fallback receives the same resolved backend as
  `acp_backend_override`, so an external role pin cannot silently fall back to
  the chat harness; an already-cached provider-backed `_bg` session is retired
  at an idle boundary before replacement.
- **Sub-agents** — `subagent._subagent_default_backend(parent_backend)` resolves
  the harness the sub-agent must run on: the `subagent` role pin, else the
  PARENT SLOT's own per-session pick, else the chat default. It answers `None`
  only when that lands on `agent.acp_backend`, because `None` means "omit the
  kwarg" and omitting it is exactly what makes the factory read that key.
  The comparison is therefore against `agent.acp_backend` and never against
  `parent_backend`: the factory is told nothing else about the parent slot, so
  measuring the parent against itself would answer `None` for a chat that moved
  off the global default and spawn the sub-agent on a harness its parent is not
  running. `subagent_manager/run.py` passes the answer as
  `acp_backend_override`. A non-`None` answer also **disables session sharing**,
  for a stronger version of the reason a model or effort override already does:
  the parent's shared runtime is a different binary, not merely a different
  model on the same one, so sharing it would run the sub-agent on the harness
  the operator moved it off.

Writes go through `agent.role_backends.<role>` in `_EDITABLE_CONFIG`, whose
value list is `_selectable_role_backends()` — a straight delegation to
`_selectable_acp_backends()` so a harness an edition registers reaches the role
pins the moment it reaches the chat pin. A write refreshes session defaults, the
same as a `role_efforts` write.

**Key APIs:**
- `start()` → `AcpClient.ensure_ready()` (spawns process, handshake, session/new)
- `stream()` → maps events from `stream_events()`
- `stream_command()` → native slash command execution
- `approve_tool()`/`reject_tool()` → JSON-RPC response
- `context_usage_pct()` → reads `last_prompt_stats.context_pct`
- `context_window_tokens()` → reads `last_prompt_stats.context_window_tokens` (the real served window from `usage_update.size`, 0 if unknown). Used by the dashboard token text instead of re-deriving the window from the model id. A mid-session `set_model` (live switch on both `AcpClient` and `AcpSessionHandle`) rebases these stats via `AcpPromptStats.rebase_to_window`: the window is re-derived from `model_registry.model_window` (0 on a registry miss), `context_used_tokens` is kept, `context_pct` is recomputed and clamped, and `context_tokens_from_usage` is cleared so the next metadata `contextUsagePercentage` can backfill against the NEW model instead of being gated forever by the old model's `usage_update`. The dashboard model-switch endpoint then broadcasts one `context_usage` WS event with `reset: true` (both live-switch and session-reset paths, single and bulk), which lets the frontend reducer replace or delete its stored per-slot token counts — per-turn events without `reset` never delete. The post-compaction pct-0 broadcast carries the same flag.
- `compact()` → sends `/compact` via `send_command()`
- `cancel()` → sends `session/cancel` notification
- `supports_effort()` / `change_effort(level)` / `clear_effort()` → reasoning-effort control (see below)
- `is_alive()` → `AcpClient.is_responsive()` (600s stale threshold)
- `is_process_alive()` → OS-level process check

**Reasoning effort** (Opus/Sonnet/Fable **and GPT-5.x** — shared vocabulary in `effort.py`: levels `low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, capability via `model_supports_effort`, resolution via `resolve_effort_for_model` with priority slot-override > workspace default > None). Capability is a conservative allowlist of known-capable families (`opus`/`sonnet`/`fable`/`gpt`, minus a hard `haiku` exclusion), verified against kiro-cli 2.12/2.13 over ACP — kiro rejects `/effort` on the other third-party models (deepseek/minimax/glm/qwen/auto) with "Effort configuration is currently not available on <model>". A new model family lands as unsupported until confirmed (safe default: the slider hides). Applied via a workspace `cli.json` overlay at `<work_dir>/.kiro/settings/cli.json` → `chat.modelDefaults.<model>.<key>.effort`, written before every spawn (`_write_cli_overlay`) and recovered on init (`_read_cli_overlay`) for server-restart resilience. The `<key>` sub-object is **family-specific** (`effort_settings_key`): `output_config` for Claude models, `reasoning` for GPT models — kiro silently ignores the wrong key, so a mismatched shape would survive a live push but drop on respawn. `_write_cli_overlay` removes stale effort from the other family key while preserving unrelated settings; `_clear_cli_overlay_effort`/`_read_cli_overlay` sweep both keys. Live change pushes `/effort` with the TuiCommand args form (`send_command(args={"level": …})`). The factory threads `reasoning_effort_override` → `effort_per_model[current_model]`; when a valid requested effort cannot be threaded (the resolved model is empty or not effort-capable) the factory's gate logs one warning naming the level, the session, and the resolved model (or `auto` when unresolved, matching the spawn-side `effort_dropped` verdict) — the single drop authority reporting its own decision, covering every surface (spawn, dashboard slot, cron) that funnels through it, an explicit `reasoning_effort_override` always warns (a caller's own dropped request is the event the gate exists to surface), while a drop sourced only from the config default (`agent.reasoning_effort`) is deduped once per (model, level) for the factory's lifetime so one static configuration fact does not repeat on every construction. A `reasoning_effort_override` also bypasses the warm pool (`bypass_effort`): a pre-warmed provider was built without the override and post-claim fixups never touch effort, so the override must reach a fresh factory call to be delivered at all. The dashboard handler routes through `change_effort`/`clear_effort` and only resets the session when there is no live provider. Non-effort-capable models persist the slot value without a live apply or reset.

**MCP Tool Search** (kiro backend only — see https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/mcp/tool-search/): loads MCP tool specs on demand ("search-and-call") instead of sending every tool definition each turn, keeping the context window clear when many MCP servers are configured. Gated by the `agent.tool_search` config toggle (default **on**; auto-surfaces as a Settings toggle since the schema is generated from the dataclass).
- Applied via the **same** workspace `cli.json` overlay used for effort (`<work_dir>/.kiro/settings/cli.json`), written deterministically before every spawn and on each restart by `_write_tool_search_overlay` (called from `AcpProvider.__init__` and `start()`). When enabled it writes the flat keys `toolSearch.enabled=true` plus `toolSearch.minPct`/`toolSearch.minTokens`, taken from `agent.tool_search_min_pct` / `agent.tool_search_min_tokens` (defaults `5` / `50000`, mirroring kiro-cli's own thresholds; clamped to 0-100 and >= 0, non-numeric falls back to the default); when disabled it writes `toolSearch.enabled=false` and drops both thresholds.
- **Why the thresholds are not forced to 0:** deferral costs a round-trip — a deferred tool's spec is absent from the model's tool list, so the first direct call fails with `A tool with the name '<name>' does not exist` and has to be recovered with `tool_search`. That only pays once the specs are genuinely large, which is what the thresholds express (kiro-cli defers when EITHER is exceeded). An earlier build hard-coded both to `0`, imposing the round-trip on every install including ones far below the threshold. Setting both to `0` still restores unconditional deferral for operators who want it. The thresholds are written **explicitly** rather than omitted, so a machine carrying the old forced zeros is actually migrated instead of silently keeping them.
- Writing both `true` and `false` makes the KiroCrew toggle authoritative over any value in the user's global `~/.kiro/settings/cli.json`. The write is merge-safe with the effort `chat.modelDefaults` keys in the same file.
- **external adapters (Claude Code and Codex)** — no-op. Tool Search is a
  kiro-cli feature; `_apply_tool_search_overlay` writes only for the
  runtime-backed Kiro/KAS capability set.

- **Resume guard:** `session/load` (resume) is only attempted when the prior session transcript exists on disk (`~/.kiro/sessions/cli/<sid>.json`). A stale persisted sid with no transcript falls back to `session/new`, preventing a fresh conversation from replaying old turns (which inflated base context).
- **Working dir:** `AcpProvider.cwd` overrides the `LLMProvider` ABC default so `session_map` persists the real workspace path. AcpProvider's work_dir lives on the inner client (`_client._work_dir`), so the prior `getattr(provider, "_work_dir", "")` persisted `""` for all ACP sessions — `provider.cwd` fixes resume-cwd-override.

### Config (`config/loader.py`)

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "provider": "acp",
    "model": "auto"
  }
}
```

- `agent.provider` is fixed to `"acp"` (enum `["acp"]`); there is no provider to choose.
- `create_provider_factory()` returns a `Callable` that creates the kiro-cli `AcpProvider`.

An agent spec's model is consumed by kiro-cli before Kiro Crew reaches
`session/new`, so the live-session entitlement guard cannot diagnose a wrong
wire spelling at spawn time. Agent create/update validate a pin before
persisting it: they reuse the role-model validator for advertised ids and
`model_registry.acp_id_correction` for the offline positive case where the
registry recognizes a non-ACP spelling and can name its ACP id. Unknown ids are
allowed because they may be valid regional or newly released ids; empty and
`auto` continue to defer. Doctor applies the same correction audit to every
discoverable user- and project-scoped spec.

### MCP Server Registration

Kiro CLI receives managed MCP servers from its rendered agent. Claude and Codex
receive the always-emitted Crew servers through their ACP `session/new` and
`session/load` requests. The external-adapter entries omit `autoApprove`, and
Claude additionally disables its native `Agent`/`Task` tools and scopes explicit
`ask` rules to Crew MCP names so Crew's `spawn_run` path is used and each call
reaches ACP permission handling.

MCP servers are passed directly in the `session/new` params. Kiro's rendered agent
also merges user-configured servers. External adapters receive the two managed
servers (`kirocrew-core`, `kirocrew-cron` — see `agent.py:_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS`);
user-configured servers remain an edition-owned seam and are not copied into those
sessions.

### SessionManager (`session.py`)

- Provider-agnostic via factory (one provider: `AcpProvider` with a selected harness)
- Calls `repair_agent_configs()` on gateway startup and periodically
- context_info() reports model/agent
- Resume: calls `set_resume_session_id()` before `start()`

### Subagent Approval Mode Inheritance (`subagent.py`)

Subagents inherit the global `approval_mode=auto` config as a final fallback when:
1. No parent session key exists (spawned independently), OR
2. Parent session key exists but the session is no longer in the store (garbage-collected)

If the parent session is alive but returned no policy, deny-by-default applies — the session is intentionally non-auto. This ensures subagents spawned from dashboard sessions still get auto-approval even if the parent session is GC'd before the subagent executes.

### Automatic recovery

Provider-level recovery mechanisms that fire automatically without user intervention:

**Interactive transient-5xx retry** (a270bd1f; post-token recovery c6fe60a): The interactive dashboard/Slack `chat_runner` stream loop retries a transient backend 5xx (InternalServerError / DispatchFailure / ConnectionReset, JSON-RPC `-32603`) through the shared `llm_helpers` transient classifier + backoff, **without** resetting the still-alive session. Auth/validation errors are excluded (fail-fast); on retry-budget exhaustion a clean error surfaces on a still-resumable session. This extends the unattended `stream_and_collect` retry path (previously deferred for the interactive loop) to interactive callers.

A transient 5xx that arrives *after* the turn already emitted output (the `_turn_emitted` guard is set once any assistant token streams or a tool call fires) no longer drops the turn. Instead it **RECOVERS ONCE**: the streamed partial is preserved as a finalized assistant message, a brief recovery notice is appended, and a *continue* instruction (not the original prompt) is re-queued onto the SAME live ACP session — which still holds the interrupted turn's context (original prompt, streamed partial, and any completed tool results) — so the model resumes from where it stopped rather than restarting. The recovery is one-shot per genuine user turn: the allowance is consumed only when a recovery is actually enqueued and is refreshed at the start of the next real user turn, never on the synthetic recovery turn, so a repeated post-token 5xx during recovery surfaces a clean error instead of looping. When Stop is active or the turn is nested (`_prompt_depth != 0`) the partial + notice are still shown but nothing is re-queued (the allowance is left unconsumed). This recovery **also applies to turns that already fired a tool call** — an ACCEPTED TRADEOFF (owner decision), rather than failing fast: a mid-stream 5xx is rare, and the continue instruction tells the model to resume and not re-run tools that already completed. A residual double-execution risk remains only for a side-effecting/destructive tool that was still *in flight* when the 5xx hit; the owner accepts that narrow risk in favor of recovering the turn.

**Compaction-failure notice backoff** (dashboard-chat; `dashboard/chat_utils.py:_broadcast_compaction_result`): Per-turn compaction failures no longer spam the chat. Per slot, `_compaction_fail_streak` counts consecutive failures and the first `_COMPACTION_NOTICE_SHOW_FIRST_N` (=2) are shown verbatim ("❌ Compaction failed: …"); further failures within the `_COMPACTION_FAIL_COOLDOWN_SECS` (60s) `_compaction_fail_cooldown_until` window are suppressed, and when the cooldown elapses a single collapsed "failed Nx in a row … Consider `/compact` manually" message is shown with `/compact` guidance. A `completed` status resets the streak/cooldown. `acp/client.py:_handle_compaction_status` logs the raw failed-compaction notification params at WARNING (kiro-cli carries no dedicated error field on failure). This is a UX/spam guard only — the underlying compaction still runs every turn on kiro-cli's schedule — and is distinct from SessionManager's proactive auto-compact cooldown.

**Compaction resets — then accurately re-reports — the context meter**: a `completed` `_kiro.dev/compaction/status` drops the stale token stats at the provider chokepoints — `AcpClient._handle_compaction_status` (every dispatch loop plus `wait_for_compaction`) and the mirrored sites in `AcpSessionHandle` (prompt dispatch loop and its `wait_for_compaction` queue-drain path) — via `AcpPromptStats.reset_after_compaction()`: `context_used_tokens`/`context_pct` zero out and `context_tokens_from_usage` clears (so fresh metadata can re-derive instead of being gated by the pre-compaction `usage_update`), while `context_window_tokens` is kept (the model did not change, so the served window still holds). kiro-cli then emits a fresh `_kiro.dev/metadata` with the real post-compaction `contextUsagePercentage` about a second after the completed status (live-probe confirmed), so `wait_for_compaction` grace-drains up to `_POST_COMPACTION_METADATA_GRACE_SECS` (5s) for it on `AcpClient`, `AcpSessionHandle`, and `AcpProvider`'s cached mid-turn result path (which delegates to the inner client via the `AcpSessionProvider` pass-through); the drain only ends on a metadata frame actually carrying a `contextUsagePercentage` (a credits-only frame is consumed but does not end it), re-queues non-metadata frames before any poison sentinel, and lets process death (`AcpError`) propagate; `_backfill_context_window` prefers the **kept served window** over the model registry when deriving tokens from that percentage, since the served size can differ from the static entry (e.g. opus served at [1m] vs a 200K registry row). The dashboard's manual `/compact` path then broadcasts the REAL post-compaction numbers when the drain captured them, and only falls back to `context_usage {pct: 0, reset: true}` (the same contract as the threshold auto-compact callback and the in-turn `_broadcast_compaction_result` chokepoint) when no metadata arrived — the meter then self-corrects on the next turn's telemetry. A failed/timed-out compaction leaves the counts untouched and re-sends them as-is. `_context_usage_payload` treats `used == 0` with a known window as "not measured yet" and omits the token fields, so the unconditional end-of-turn broadcast cannot overwrite a reset with a false "0 / W tokens" claim.

### Installation

Kiro uses `kiro-cli` over ACP — install it per its own docs, ensure it is on
`PATH`, and run `kiro-cli login`. Claude Code and Codex use their respective ACP
adapters and authentication. `kirocrew doctor` reports the availability of all
selectable harnesses.


## AcpProvider: shared-runtime startup

`AcpProvider.start()` branches on the backend. Every shared-runtime branch below
enters the same `AcpRuntime.spawn()` cold-start coordinator (default 2 concurrent
spawn+initialize handshakes per gateway loop); admission is backend-neutral, so an
adapted runtime harness neither bypasses the bound nor changes the Kiro path.

- **Kiro/KAS (`ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME`)** → `_start_kiro_runtime()`. This spawns an
  `AcpRuntime` (carrying the provider's sandbox mode, extra env, and MCP-gateway
  overlay/socket), resumes via `runtime.load_session()` when a prior transcript
  exists or otherwise `runtime.create_session()`, applies the configured model,
  and replaces `self._client` with an `AcpSessionProvider` (which implements the
  same interface as `AcpClient`, so downstream callers are unchanged). Any
  failure after `spawn()` kills the runtime so a half-initialised session never
  leaks an orphaned `kiro-cli`.
- **Claude Code/Codex (`ACP_BACKENDS_CONFIG_MODEL`)** → legacy
  `AcpClient.ensure_ready()`.

`AcpProvider.is_session_sharing_eligible` is membership in
`ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING` (harness-parity H6), not `not is_claude_backend`:
a capability granted by the absence of one backend is inherited by every backend
added later. It is what `SessionManager.is_session_sharing_eligible()` consults
to decide whether a parent session can host multiplexed subagent sessions. The
invariants governing what an added harness may and may not change are in
[harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md).
